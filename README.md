StreetviewPhotoMap
==================

Command line tools for downloading Streetview Imagery from Google and combining them into a photo map.

Example output: http://davidstolarsky.com/18154

** Note: This code worked as of ~January 2012. It uses an undocumented Streetview API which may no longer work. See https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/ for a new official API.

** Note 2: The code for cutting a single output image into a tiled map suitable for web interaction is not contained here. I used something that export "Zoomify" format, which OpenLayers.js supports. https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/ and/or http://www.maptiler.org/ are GUI applications that can do similar things.
